# Grindr Access

## Overview

`grindr_user.py` is a Python module that provides a set of functions to interact with the Grindr API. Grindr is a popular social networking and dating app. This module allows you to perform various actions, such as logging in, retrieving user profiles, sending taps, getting user information, and more.

## Usage

To use `grindrUser.py`, you should follow these steps:

1. Import the module:

    ```python
    from grindr_user import GrindrUser
    ```

2. Create an instance of the `GrindrUser` class:

    ```python
    user = GrindrUser()
    ```

3. Log in to your Grindr account using your email and password:

    ```python
    user.login("your_email@example.com", "your_password")
    ```

4. Use the provided methods to interact with the Grindr API. Here are some of the available methods:

   - `get_profiles(lat, lon)`: Retrieve user profiles near a specific location.

   - `get_taps()`: Get the list of taps received.

   - `tap(profileId, type)`: Send a tap to a user with the specified profile ID and type.

   - `get_profile(profileId)`: Get the profile information of a user with the specified profile ID.

   - `get_profileStatuses(profileIdList)`: Get the status of multiple profiles using their IDs.

   - `get_album(profileId)`: Get the album information of a user with the specified profile ID.

   - `sessions(email)`: Get session data or renew an existing session using an email.

   - `generate_plain_auth()`: Generate plain authentication information.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the module to retrieve user profiles:

```python
from grindr_user import GrindrUser

# Create an instance of the GrindrUser class
user = GrindrUser()

# Log in to your Grindr account
user.login("your_email@example.com", "your_password")

# Get user profiles near a specific location (e.g., latitude 123.456 and longitude 789.012)
profiles = user.get_profiles(123.456, 789.012)

# Print the response
print(profiles)
```
You can also refer to the example.py file for usage and implementation examples.

## To-Do

- [ ] gen_l_dev_info should be consistent over multiple requests.
